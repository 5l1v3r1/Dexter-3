# README: Project DEXTER

#
# Dexter is designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate the power of
# Python as a malware language.  Dexter is designed using Python 3.4+ and to
# be compiled into a Windows .EXE using Py2Exe.  This project is also designed
# to be highly modular so that individual modules can be used by themselves or
# so that specific modules (e.g., communications protocols) can be swapped out
# while maintaining functionality.
